Ajax stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML is a web development technique using many web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous web applications. With Ajax, Web Pages can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By de-coupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows web pages to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page.

Ajax is not a single technology but rather a group of technologies like HTML and CSS are used in combination, to mark up and style the information. The Web Page will be modified by Java Script to dynamically display and allow the user to interact with the new information. The built-in “XMLHttpRequest” object within Java Script is used to execute Ajax on Web Pages allowing Web Applications to load content on to the screen without refreshing the page. XML or JSON are used for inter-change of the data. Ajax is not a new technology, or different language, just existing technologies used in new ways.

Note: different browsers implement the Ajax differently that means if you’re adopting the typical Java Script way to implement the Ajax you must write different code for different browsers to ensure that Ajax would work cross-browser. But fortunately, JQuery simplifies the process of implementing Ajax by taking care of those browser differences. It offers simple methods such as load(), $.get(), $.post(), etc. to implement the Ajax that works seamlessly across all the browsers. XML is commonly used as the format for receiving server data, although any format, including plain text, can be used. In practice, modern implementations commonly utilize JSON instead of XML due to the advantage of JSON being native to Java Script.
